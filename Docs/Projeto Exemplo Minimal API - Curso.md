Welcome to Minimal API with .NET 10 and C#, the most comprehensive and practical course available for mastering modern API development using Microsoft’s streamlined Minimal API architecture. In this hands-on, project-driven course, you will build a fully functional, production-ready API used to manage fictional research sites, artifacts, catalog records, media files, and user accounts inside the Aeon Registry system. Whether you are new to .NET or transitioning from MVC controllers, this course guides you step-by-step through designing, structuring, building, documenting, and deploying a real application following industry best practices.

Why This Course Stands Out

This is not a basic demo API. You will architect a complete multi-layered system with:

Authentication and role-based authorization
Identity API endpoints (with custom overrides)
Fully designed Site and Artifact management systems
Public and private endpoint architecture
Media upload, validation, and binary image delivery
PostgreSQL integration through Entity Framework Core
Production-level error handling and filters
Branded Swagger documentation
Deployment to Railway using Docker
Static file hosting, maps, and a homepage
Every feature is taught through real implementation, not theory.

What You Will Learn

By the end of this course, you’ll be able to build professional-grade Minimal API applications, including:

Minimal API Architecture:

Organize projects using entities, DTOs, services, filters, and endpoint groups
Implement consistent CRUD endpoint patterns
Apply projection and mapping techniques for response models
